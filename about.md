Working in sales operations sparked my interest in doing more with data. After exploring options, I joined BrainStation's Data Science bootcamp. I am excited to pair my business experience and data skills as a data scientist.

### Date Science + Business + People. What does this mean?

For me, the most intriguing data science is focused on solving tangible problems in our world today. To this end, my background provides me with a unique perspective for balancing the needs of people and the business, as well as the technical skills to get the job done. 

For example, as a social worker, I learned to ask good questions to identify needs and potential solutions. This perspective centers on people. 

As an operations manager, I created and improved processes to improve the company’s bottom line. This perspective centers on the business.

Finally, data science gives me the technical skills to test hypotheses and generate useful predictive models. This perspective centers on how. 

Data science in isolation is interesting. Figure out how to monetize it, and that is powerful. Leverage data science to improve people’s lives, and that is worthwhile.
