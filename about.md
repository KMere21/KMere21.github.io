With an undergraduate degree in social work and 5+ years’ experience working in cultural intelligence and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), my passion is to center data science on the human experience to improve people’s lives. As the impact of data science grows, it’s crucial to thoughtfully consider the impact on real people’s lives and the world around us.

Data has powerful, exciting potential. However, it does not exist in a vacuum. We risk feeding data our own biases, and all data must be interpreted. I bring a holistic perspective to data interpretation.

From social work, I consider psychological, sociological, political, and biological influences. I also consider potential impact at an individual, group, societal, and environmental level. My research and statistics foundation began with my social work degree, completing a practical, 3-part stats series as part of the program.

From my work with cultural intelligence and DEI, I bring a cultural lens to data. How we relate to one another and the world is deeply culturally shaped, from how we interpret colors to how we persuade others or get buy-in. Further, I bring strategies for disrupting bias, which is critical as bias can unintentionally and intentionally shape data, from how it is collected and what is included to how it is interpreted. 

From my MBA and experience working at a startup, I bring a practical, business-minded perspective. I understand the needs of a business and the priorities of different stakeholders. I've honed my skills a cross-functional collaboration, identifying pain points, and building consensus achieve solutions.
